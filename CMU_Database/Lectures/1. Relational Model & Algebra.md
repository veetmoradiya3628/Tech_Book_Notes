- Relational Model
- Relational Algebra
- Alternative Data Models


- Flat File Database 
	- There are multiple issues there
- data models
	- Relational
	- Key/Value
	- Graph
	- Document/JSON/XML/Object
	- Wide-Column/Column Family
	- Array (Vector, Matrix, Tensor)
	- Hierarchical
	- Network
	- Semantic
	- Entity-Relationship
- Schema
- Relational model
	- The relational model defines a database abstraction based on relations to avoid maintenance overhead.
	- Structure
	- Integrity
	- Manipulation
- Table
- Primary Keys
- Foreign Keys
- Constraints
- DML (Data Manipulation Languages)
- Relational Algebra
	- Select
		- Choose a subset of the tuples from a relation that satisfy a selection predicate.
	- Projection
		- Generate a relation with tuples that contains only the specified attributes
	- Union
		- Generate a relation that contains all tuples that appear in either only one or both input relations.
	- Intersection
		- Generate a relation that contains all tuples that appear in both of the input relations.
	- Difference
		- Record appear in first but not in second.
	- Product
		- Combined output with cartesian product.
	- Join
		- Common parameter match of two relations.
- Document Data Model
	- A collection of documents with key value pair collection.
- Vector Data Model
	- At their core, these systems use specialized indexes to perform NN searches quickly.
