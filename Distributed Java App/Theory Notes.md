##### Overview
- Where can we find Distributed Systems ?
	- Distributed systems are everywhere!
	- Every time we:
		- watch a movie on demand
		- shop online
		- order a ride share service through our mobile phone
		- search for something online
- Why Distributed Systems ?
	- Those companies are running highly scalable distributed systems in order to:
		- handle millions of users
		- Petabytes of data
		- Provide consistent user experience
- The Cloud and Distributed Systems
	- Even the simplest web site is running on a distributed system
	- Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP,...) is a distributed system designed for companies and SW developers
- The virtues of a Distributed System
	- You are not aware of the complexities of the system
	- It just works!
	- Feels like a single machine
	- Dedicated specifically for you
- The problem with centralized systems
	- Vertical scaling limited
	- Single point of failure
	- High latency - poor user experience
	- Security and privacy
	- Solution :- Distributed system
- Definition :- 
	- *A Distributed system is a system of several processes running on different computers, communicating with each other through the network, and are sharing a state or are working together to achieve a common goal*
- No common goal, not a distributed systems
